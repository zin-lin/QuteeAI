#### Overview
With the use of 3D printers and accessible hardware like micro computers and servo motors, we can build robots in-house that are ready to be used in academic research. In this project, the group will build and test a Qutee robot. The Qutee is an open-source quadruped robot. All the parts to build the robot are easily found on the market and 3D printed with the facilities at ENU.

The group will 3D print the legs and body of the robot, assemble them, including the motors, controller (CPU and motor hub) and battery. Then, the group will program the robot to tests its capacities. The second part of the project includes the use of artificial intelligence to make the robot autonomous. At this point, several techniques can be applied, like machine learning, evolutionary computation or intrinsic motivations.

An example of the robot used for research can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12080 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgGNvIsRh7Q

#### Deliverables
The main deliverable is the robot itself. The robot will be 3D printed by the students using the printers and material provided by the university. The university will provide all the hardware also to fully assemble the robot: motors, controller, cabling, etc.

Other deliverable include the software to control the robot. This code can be stored in our git repository. This software should include the actions to send to the motors (joint angle position) and the reading of the sensors included in the robot (IMU, joint positions, etc). An interface to the most used robotic software like Python and ROS can be built for this project.

Last deliverable is the autonomous control of the robot using some of the AI techniques mentioned before.

A report with a list of improvements for future iterations of the robot.

#### Resources
All the hardware necessary to print the robot parts (3D printers, plastic material, etc).

The hardware to assembly the robot (motors, sensors, controller, cables, battery, charger, etc).

CAD description for the 3D printed parts.

Access to lab B62 to work on the robot and print the parts.

The software can be written in any language but Python or C++ are the most used for robotics.

Knowledge of ROS is a plus but not required. Knowledge of AI and machine learning is also a plus but is not required.
