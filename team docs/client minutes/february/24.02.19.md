#### Progress:  
(Since last meeting)  

* Reply from github repo owners  
* 3d parts stl files have been modified  
* Purchased parts have been delivered (missing 7 motors as mentioned last week)  
* Can now visualise URDF files  

---  

#### Agenda:  
(What was discussed)  

* Reply recieved from github repo owners, they are flushing software to micro-controller, still communicating with them. Don't think ESP can handl ROS2, suspect one module is not compatible  
* STL of new version of leg (one part) has been completed, all printing is expected to be complete by late tomorrow
* Expecting to start looking at soldering boards and testing motors tomorrow  
* Documentation on dynamixel for voltages to send to motors and how to connect etc. **Important** to not damage motors as will not be able to get any more  
* Client appreciates documentation being created  
* Can visualise URDF, but struggling to intergrate STL or dae files as mesh to create URDF  

---  

#### Decisions:  
(Project decisions made)  

* Read (joint positions/IMU) along with ability to set joint positions is sufficient for project - worrying about communication via ROS etc can be a later issue    
* Need to use these motors - as only have 5, can only assemble what we have. Maybe assemble rest in a way that can be disassembled easily when other motors arrive. Should have ability to move a little, even crawling  
* Ok to create URDF file with basic shapes instead of using STL, this can maybe be added later to make it look better if can find a way to intergrate, but a lower priority. Can potentially get center of mass values for URDF from fusion (need to look into), however, will be ok to use center of part as center of mass, and set mass as 0.1kg or something (very light - NOT zero)

#### Action Items:  
(Items to be completed, reponsible person and completion date if applicable)  

* Send video to Simon if build robot and have it moving (even if just 1 leg) - **@everyone**  
* Start URDF creation for actual robot with basic shapes - **@Andy**  
* Look into obtaining part details (mass / center of mass / inertia details etc) from fusion 360 - **@Guy**  
* Look into if its possible to integrate STL files with URDF (or if theres a specific file type that URDF allows for mesh files) - **@Guy**  
* Test motors - **@Damian**  
* Start documentation - **@Nicole**  
* Start soldering IMU/ada/power board pins - **@Aman / @Andy**  
* Management duties, docs, collect parts - **@Malcolm**

#### Next Meeting:
(When and where)  

* Monday 26th February - B62 and online
